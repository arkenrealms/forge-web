    description: `Known best for their brutality and ruthlessness in combat, barbarians are both feared and admired across Haerra. Unlike other disciplines, few outsiders can “train” to become barbarians. Most barbarians are born, begotten by their tribe. The tribe serves as a central focus to barbarian life: a close-knit community dedicated to the preservation of their way of life and honoring their ancestors. Barbarians exist in almost all cultures and climates across Haerra, from the desert tribes of Kharsh to the Ovaraaks tribe in the Frostlands. No matter their origin, a single barbarian is often considered to be worth ten soldiers, and their fearlessness is envied by many.`,

      'Whether by tireless study or natural talent, mages unlock the secrets of mana energy and manipulate it to serve any purpose. From creating simple illusions to tearing mountains from the earth, the extent of a mage’s power is determined by their keenness and dedication. With such power, however, there is a natural danger. There exists a voice in the mind of every mage, one which whispers promises of greater and greater power, threatening to consume the individual entirely. Only the bravest and wisest of souls can truly master the arcane without it turning against them.',

    description: `Champions of justice and beacons of hope to their people, paladins dedicate themselves to a cause they consider upright. Whether a Valburn Corruptor dedicated to Azorag or a non-religious member of the Paladins of Ashyrah, the path of a paladin is a long and difficult one. Paladins must not only perfect their martial abilities, but also learn to heal and protect their allies: all within a strict code of conduct. Paladins are always watchful and prepared for adversity, and refuse to waver even in the face of their worst nightmares.`,

    description: `Blessed of the earth and the chosen people of nature, druids seek balance above all else. Although often considered as simply guardians of forests and wildlife, druids serve the natural order of things. If a fire is needed to cleanse the forest, the druids aid in this process. If a predator grows too strong and threatens to drive others to extinction, the druids intervene. Where nature takes different forms--even those often considered twisted or evil--there exist druids to watch over it. From the Faytree to Hexwood, these guardians of nature will likely persist even as the buildings of Haerra rise and fall to dust.`,

      'Born from all walks of life, assassins are familiar with the darkest corners of Haerra. Some assassins dwell in plain sight, utilizing undetected poisons and traps as their weapons, while others strike from the shadows with blade and bolt. No matter their method, assassins are feared by all: from lord to king to emperor, no one is ever truly safe from the silent blade. Not much is known about their organization or varied hierarchies, as few who investigate live to report their findings.',

    description: `Dwelling in secluded forests, highlands, and even deserts, the many rangers of Haerra share a similar purpose: to protect their people and lands from forces that seek to exploit them. As city borders creep larger and empires expand, these protectors of the wild stand stalwart against encroaching civilization. Rangers use their knowledge of their environment as a powerful tool in both combat and life, and are known to be expert archers, swordmasters, and trappers--of both monsters and humanoids. Although often kind and selfless if treated likewise, rangers make for formidable foes if threatened.`,

    description: `Contrary to popular belief, necromancers are not inherently evil. Although their power dabbles in forces too gruesome for many on Haerra, be it animating skeletons or communicating with dead ancestors, necromancers serve as watchers of the border between life and death. While some necromancers do utilize their ichor energy for selfish gain and power-mongering, others use their necromantic skills for good: disguised as healers and seers. Whether raising allies from the dead or ensuring them a smooth passage into death, necromancers face a tough question: can you do good in a world that despises you, or will you become the tyrant they assume you to be?`,

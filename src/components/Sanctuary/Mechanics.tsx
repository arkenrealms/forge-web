      Ladder Exclusives
      <br />
      Challenged Zones
      <br />
      Throughout the week, some zones will be challenged². The enemies in these zones will be harder with increased
      level, which will give monsters access to different skills, which will change their strategy while fighting you,
      but of course also improve loot drops.
      <br />
      Progressive Content
      <br />
      When a ladder resets, much of the world will be restricted. Periodically, for example once per week, content will
      unlock. The reason for this is to 1) allow a chance for the average player to catch up and 2) acts as a barrier to
      encourage competition and thinking outside the box while waiting for unlocks. For example, players may strategize
      on specific materials to farm, or spend the downtime battling each other. 3) Gives the ladder more longevity, so
      it's not a no-life grind for 2 weeks with nothing left to do.
      <br />
      Dungeon Unlocks
      <br />
      Some dungeons will only be accessible via weekly quests on a performance basis. Essentially if you perform better,
      you get priority to access the dungeon. You find the dungeon in the world, and only one player can access it at
      one time, for a specific time period. When that ends, the next player in the queue can access it. If somebody with
      a better performance comes, they will be pushed up the queue. This incentivizes performance, skill, knowledge,
      without completely preventing access.
      <br />
      Restrictions
      <br />
      Items from non-ladder characters or other Arken games cannot be transfered into ladder characters. This is to
      provide more balanced and fair gameplay for the duration of the ladder. At the end of the ladder the characters
      are automatically converted to non-ladder characters, where there are zero restrictions.
      <br />
      <br />
      Non-ladder Notes
      <br />
      There will be no restrictions on non-ladder characters³. That means there won't be any area restrictions, and any
      items can be transfered in.
      <br />
      Destroyable World & Material Gathering
      <br />
      Many of the structures in the world will be destructible. Once destroyed, they will not respawn. Materials and
      other items have a chance to drop from specific structures, which are useful for recipes. That means you could
      gather shimmering shards from End of Time once and only once. The rolls for these items are generated based on
      your character when it's created as so to avoid exploitation.¹

      1. This is similar to how Pokemon were assigned in the original games - the pokemon that could be found all trees
      are based on your character. 2. This is similar to Terrorized Zones in Diablo 2 Resurrected. The monsters in these
      zones change in power based on your character. However, mechanically ours will be different as our monsters become
      more strategic and have different abilities based on level. 3. This is similar to ladder characters in Diablo 2.
